# Behavior Cloning (BC) and Behavior Cloning from Observation (BCO)

- Implementation for Behavior Cloning (BC) and behavior cloning from observation (BCO) ([pdf](https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.01954v2)) in Pytorch for [OpenAI Gym Environment](https://gym.openai.com/)

- Behavior Cloning (BC) and behavior cloning from observation (BCO) are **Imitation Learning** algorithms 

- Behavior Cloning (BC) assume that you have access to **expert's states and actions** but behavior cloning  from observation assume that you have access to **expert's States only**

## How it works?

**1- Collecting data**:

- **Learner**: exploration policy, save states and actions

- **Expert**: train expert (if you donâ€™t have one), save states only.

- **all data available** [here](https://bit.ly/37AoBlR)

**2- Train Inverse dynamic model (T)**:

- **Input**: Learner current state and Learner next state.

- **Output**: predicted Learner current action.

- **Loss function**: MSE, L1loss or NLL (predicted Learner current action, Learner current action).

**3- Test: Inverse dynamic model (T):**

- **Input**: Expert current state and Expert next state

- **Output**: predicted Expert current action.

**4- Train Behaviour model (policy):**

- **Input**: Expert current state.

- **Output**: prediction of predicted Expert current action.

- **Loss**: MSE, L1loss or NLL (prediction of predicted Expert current action, predicted Expert current action).

**5- Learner interacts with environment BCO(alpha):** 

- Learner use Behaviour model (policy) to get action given current state.

- Collect new data (states and actions)

- Use collected data to update Inverse dynamic model (T) and Behaviour model (policy) (repeat 2, 3, and 4)
